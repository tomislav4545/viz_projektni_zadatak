    <h1>Welcome to my Data Visualization Project</h1>

    <div class="subtitle">
        <h2>Single State Rate</h2>
        <p>Single state rate is used for visualizing crime rate trend over the years for selected state. Use the
            dropdown menu to select which country you want to make line graph for.
            Hovering over the circles on graph will show you additional info for the selected state such as population,
            crime rate totals and rates for certain type of crime.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subtitle">
        <h2>Multi State Rate</h2>
        <p>Multi state rate is used to plot multiple line graphs based on selected states, enabling the comparison and
            analysis of crime rate change through the years.
            Each selected state will have its own line graph displayed on the chart. To enhance readability and
            interpretation, a legend is shown next to the graph, providing
            a color that associates each line color with the corresponding state. The maximum amount of colors available
            is 10, since more than that becomes a mess on the graph.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subtitle">
        <h2>Crime Totals</h2>
        <p>The crime totals feature is used for plotting two bar graphs that show the total number of each crime by
            type. Select the year and state you want the graphs to be plotted
            for. Hovering over any bar will show all the details for that state in selected year. Additionally, you can
            play an animation that will cycle through the years and show you how
            the crime totals have changed.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="subtitle">
        <h2>Interactive Map</h2>
        <p>The interactive map is used for visualizing changes of US state crime rates through the years. The value
            which is used for determining the change of crime rate is calculated
            as the sum of the total property and violent crimes divided by population. That number is scaled to a number
            from 0 to 1, where 0 represents green color and 1 represents red
            color. You can cycle through the years using the slide or the drop-down menu. There is also a button that
            will start and pause animation that shows the crime rate change.
            You can click on any state to show additional info. When the state is clicked on the right side appear two
            bar graphs with total crime numbers and other info for the state. Hovering
            over each bar shows their value.</p>
